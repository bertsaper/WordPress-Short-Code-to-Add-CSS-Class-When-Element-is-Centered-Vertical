Description: Places jQuery code that adds and removes CSS class 
"active-bullet-emphasis" to HTML elements with the class "bullet-emphasis"
when the element is in the middle of the screen via [BulletEmphasisJQuery] shortcode. 
Plugin does not include CSS definitions, which can be added to page or site. Shortcode must be placed after all "bullet-emphasis" elements.

Important: The plugin will not function correctly if active-bullet-emphasis CSS changes the height of the element.

Original jQuery code is from https://jsfiddle.net/fa90a23u/ linked from
